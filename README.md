Files for making Javelin embedded steno work on the Koda keyboard

The Koda keyboard is designed by larrbo and released under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 License.
To make this work with Javelin, I replaced the promicro with a compatible RP2040 with 16M of storage.

This repository contains the Javelin file if you want to compile the firmware yourself, and the compiled firmware.
